<h1>CowboyFramework</h1>
===============
This is a MVC framework. It is based on the <a href="https://github.com/mosbth/lydia">Lydia framework</a>, created by Mikael Roos. 
This framework has been made as a part of the course PHP MVC at Blekinge Institute of Technology in Karlskrona, Sweden.

<h2>Installation</h2>

First you have to make the data-directory writable. This is the place where Cowboy needs to be able to write and create files.

    cd cowboy_framework; chmod 777 site/data 

Second, Cowboy has some modules that need to be initialised. You can do this through a controller.
Point your browser <code>module/install</code> link

You might have to make some changes to the .htaccess file in order to be able to get the framework working on your server.

After these steps all the changes you make should be made through the site directory.
